When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work
local?

In case of collaborating with others or if I need to work from multiple machines.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git
automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

I am not able to think of a scenario now in which manual pulling would help rather than
automatic pulling. I will update the answer as and when something comes to my mind.


Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches.  When would you
use one instead of another?

forks are clones on GitHub, whereas a clone is exact copy of the repository. Branches on
the other hand are chains of commits that one has commit-ed.
If one finds a good project and wants to make some alterations to it or contribute, then
the repository can be forked. Which means the forked repository is cloned on your GitHub
account. Then if you want to work on the repository offline it can be cloned from the
fork.


What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote
stored locally?

It helps keep tracking the relative state of local master and remote master.


How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub?  What would be easier,
and what would be harder?

Since at the moment I know only Git, it seems to be really good. So there is no point in
collaborating without Git (of-course unless something better comes up). I do know to some
extent a few alternatives to GitHub so that wouldn't be a problem.
At the moment Git and GitHub combination seems to be one of the best ways to collaborate.


When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in
master?  What benefits does each approach have?
